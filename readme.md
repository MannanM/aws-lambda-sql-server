# Connecting to SQL Server from AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is great, but I had many difficulties finding a way to connect into my RDS SQL Server instance. I started with Python and ODBC (both pyodbc and pypyodbc), but ran into so many issues with missing libraries (LD_LIBRARY_PATH of death).

I turned to Java, but I think SQL Server and Java are a bit like oil and water, so there wasnâ€™t any one place to turn to. Instead I pieced together lots of bits of information and collated it together, into what I think is a pretty compact but extendable project.
